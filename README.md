#  Module 11 Challenge
> Module 11 Challenge for ASU AI Bootcamp

In this challenge, I applied my understanding of the K-means algorithm and principal component analysis (PCA) to classify cryptocurrencies according to their price fluctuations across various timeframes. Specifically, I examined price changes of cryptocurrencies over intervals spanning 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 200 days, and 1 year.

## Installing / Getting started

Open the Crypto_Clustering.ipynb Jupyter notebook using a Jupyter server. Explore the data.

```jupyter lab
Crypto_Clustering.ipynb
```

Run each part of the code in the notebook to explore the data. Note that some of the code is provided to confirm dataset information and to create the requirements for this project.

## Requirements
python version: 3.10.14 (main, May  6 2024, 14:42:37) [Clang 14.0.6 ]
pandas version: 2.2.2
